	<p>This is a twofer.</p>
	<p>You're asked to choose between competing proposals about preschool in Seattle. You must choose only one, rather than approving them both.</p>
	<p>The first option: Initiative 107. This idea came from two unions.</p>
	<P>The second option: A property-tax levy. This is the city&rsquo;s idea. Preschools can opt in to receive the tax money if teachers meet certain criteria.</p>
