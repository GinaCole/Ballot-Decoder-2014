	<h3>Seattle measures</h3>
		<h4>Initiative 107 and Proposed Alternative: Preschool</h4>
			<p>This is actually a twofer, with competing proposals. You can choose neither, or pick one, but you can&rsquo;t approve both.</p>
			<p>The first option: Initiative 107. This idea came from two unions. It would make rules for the price of preschool, and for how much preschool teachers get paid.</p>
			<P>The second option: A property-tax levy. This is the city&rsquo;s idea, and it's narrower than I-107. Preschools could opt in to receive the tax money if teachers meet certain criteria. For someone who owns a $400,000 home, it would cost about $43 a year.</p>
			<p>The unions didn&rsquo;t want their measure to compete with the property-tax levy, but the City Council put the two measures on the ballot that way anyway.</p>
